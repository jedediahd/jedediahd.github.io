      Vegan Protein<p>Black eyed peas might seem boring, but they pack 8 grams of protein in just 1/2 cup. Like most other beans, they’re also a great source of iron, magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins. You can use them in soup or anywhere else you’d normally use beans. Their mild and nutty flavor makes a great hearty dinner!</p>
<p>This lovely veggie contains 4 grams of protein in just 1 cup, which isn’t too bad considering that same cup also contains 30 percent of your daily calcium needs, along with vitamin C, fiber, and B vitamins for only 30 calories. Let us count the ways we use broccoli!</p>
<img alt="vegan protein decathlon" src="https://www.luckyvitamin.com/images/Product/large/136501.jpg" width="856" height="480"><p>Not crazy about meat substitutes? Get your servings of soy the way it appears in nature: Straight from the soybean, still in the pod. Boiled edamame, which contains 8.4 grams of protein per half cup, can be served hot or cold and sprinkled with salt. Try it as a snack, an appetizer before dinner, or added to salads or pastas (minus the shell, of course.) Try this recipe: Roasted Edamame</p>
<p>Chia, chia, chia … what can’t this super seed do? Chia has 5 grams of protein per 2 tablespoons and is also a complete protein source. Try it all kinds of ways besides just chia pudding in our chia recipes!</p>
<p>The ingredient list on the Organic Food Bar is a thing of beauty – six ingredients long, all recognizable, all easy to pronounce. Brown rice protein, agave nectar, dates, almond butter, raisins, and seeds. That’s it!</p>
<p>Lentils are a protein favorite of many, especially those on vegetarian and vegan diets looking to pump up the protein fast. Lentils add 9 grams of protein to your meal per half cup, along with nearly 15 grams of fiber! See our lentil recipes here for tasty ways to use these little meaty legumes!</p>
<h3>Vegan Protein Source</h3><p>I eat lots of non dairy cheese. If you make them from raw seeds, they're a great source of protein. It's delicious on cucumber slices of mixed with salads (i.e. as a wrap). A great dip for kids, yummy on (sprouted) bread or as sauce in a raw vegetable lasagna. And I have to say, my non dairy cheese is quite good.</p>
<h4>Vegan Protein Chile</h4><p>All nuts contain both healthy fats and protein, making them a valuable part of a plant-based diet. But because they are high in calories—almonds, cashews, and pistachios for example, all contain 160 calories and 5 or 6 grams of protein per ounce—choose varieties that are raw or dry roasted. Nut butters, like peanut and almond butter, are also a good way to get protein, says Penner: "Look for brands with as few ingredients as possible—just nuts and maybe salt," she says. "Skip the ones with hydrogenated oils or lots of added sugar." Try this recipe: Almond Butter Cookies</p>
<p>The Simply Bar is one of those elusive products that is both vegan and lower in carbohydrates. For people who are following a lower carb diet, the Simply Bar, with only 9g effective carbohydrates, can be a perfect high-protein snack that fits such a lifestyle.</p>
<h3>Vegan Protein Amazon</h3><p>Filled with 5 grams of protein per cup, spinach is a great leafy green to enjoy as much as you can. We don’t have to tell you how to use it though … we’re sure you’re already loving this green plenty. Just in case, here are some recipes you might not have tried yet.</p>
<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/5rA7KLn8sjM" allowfullscreen="" width="856" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe><h4>Vegan Protein Balls</h4><p>This is by no means an exhaustive list of vegan protein bars – as dairy-free and vegan eating becomes more and more mainstream, there are more vegan options in “regular” grocery and convenience stores!</p>
<h4>Orgain Protein Costco</h4><p>Amaranth is similar to quinoa and teff in its nutritional content, though much tinier in size. This ancient pseudo-grain (also a seed) adds 7 grams of protein to your meals in just one cup of cooked amaranth. It’s also a fantastic source of iron, B vitamins, and magnesium. Try it in these yummy burgers that pair amaranth with lentil and all types of different spices.</p>
<h4>Vegan Protein Recipes</h4><p>But limiting or lacking in even one amino acid can have serious health implications.  Muscle and other protein structures could be dismantled to obtain the one amino acid that is missing.  Many experts suggest combining soy products with legumes or whole grains to achieve the ideal balance for the body’s requirements.  Or, if relying heavily on soy for protein requirements, it would be good to consume foods high in methionine, such as sesame seeds and brazil nuts.  Except for spinach, potatoes, or corn, most fruits and vegetables contain little methionine.</p>
<p>What used to be seen as a boring vegan protein source has now been transformed into everything from breakfast to entrees, and yes, even desserts too. This protein source’s main attractive nature is that it can be flavored however you want and adds a rich, creamy texture or chewy texture to your food depending on if you buy firm or soft tofu. See our tasty tofu recipes to add  a whopping 10 grams of protein (check labels) per cup of chopped tofu.</p>
<p>Black beans are one of the richest sources of antioxidants and one of the healthiest beans of all beans and legumes. Their dark color indicates their strong antioxidant content and they also have less starch than some other beans. One favorite way to enjoy them is to make black bean burritos, but that’s not the only way to use them. Try these delicious black bean recipes to add 8 grams of protein per 1/2 cup of these beans to your plate.</p>
<p>Filled with antioxidants and fiber, not to mention protein, edamame is the young green soybean and so delicious! It’s filled with a nutty sweetness and packs in 8.5 grams of protein in just 1/2 cup. Add to salads, soups, burgers, soba noodles, and more. You can even snack on it raw and roast it like chickpeas for a crunchy snack.</p>
<h3>Vegan Protein Pancakes</h3><p>Methionine assists in breaking down fats and thus prevents build-up of fat in the arteries and liver.  Since it is converted to cysteine, it also assists with the removal of heavy metals (including lead) from the body.  It’s also a powerful antioxidant, removing free radicals produced in the natural metabolic processes of the body.</p>
<p>Milk can lurk in protein products under lots of different disguises. Avoid any products containing whey or whey isolate, which are proteins derived from milk – in fact, the quickest way to ensure your bar is dairy-free is to scan all the way back to the allergen statement and look for the phrase “Contains Milk.”</p>
<p>The Food Monster app has over 8k recipes and 500 are free. To access the rest, you have to pay a subscription fee but it’s totally worth it because not only do you get instant access to 8k+ recipes, you get 10 NEW recipes every day! You can also make meal plans, add bookmarks, read feature stories, and browse recipes across hundreds of categories like diet, cuisine, meal type, occasion, ingredient, popular, seasonal, and so much more!</p>
<h3>Vegan Protein Bars Recipe</h3><p>Important: This chart lists the vegetable/nut/legume sources with the highest amounts of the amino acids per a 200 calorie serving.  However, this may NOT be the most practical source!  For instance, 200 calories of watercress provide an abundance of essential amino acid daily requirements, but having only 4 calories per cup, 200 calories would equate to 50 cups!  Or egg whites are a terrific source of essential amino acids, but 200 calories of egg whites mean you would need to eat 11 eggs!  Not my way of starting the day.  With that in mind, I’ve compiled a list of great, enjoyable food sources to meet the daily requirements, at the end of this page.</p>
<p>Bet you didn't know you can get protein from chocolate! Unsweetened cocoa powder—the type used in baking or making hot chocolate from scratch—contains about 1 gram of protein per tablespoon. The powder is bitter all by itself, however, so most recipes call for lots of sugar and fat (usually butter or other dairy), as well. Stick with nonfat (or almond milk) and choose calorie-free sweeteners for a healthy, low-cal hot cocoa, or add it to air-popped popcorn (along with sugar, allspice, and cayenne pepper) for a sweet and spicy whole-grain treat. Try this recipe: Cocoa-Cayenne Popcorn</p>
<p>Most grains contain a small amount of protein, but quinoa—technically a seed—is unique in that it contains more than 8 grams per cup, including all nine essential amino acids that the body needs for growth and repair, but cannot produce on its own. (Because of that, it's often referred to as a "perfect protein.") Plus, it's amazingly versatile: Quinoa can be added to soup or vegetarian chili during winter months, served with brown sugar and fruit as a hot breakfast cereal, or tossed with vegetables and a vinaigrette to make a refreshing summer salad. Try this recipe: Toasted Quinoa With Chiles and Corn</p>
